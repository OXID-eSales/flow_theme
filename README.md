# Flow Theme

## General Information

*Flow* is a responsive theme for all OXID eShop editions.


## Installation

### Step 1: Select the appropriate branch

* Branch ``b-3.x`` contains *Flow* for OXID eShop compilation 6.3 and 6.4
* Branch ``master`` contains *Flow* for OXID eShop master branch's latest commits

### Step 2: Get the source code

Check out the appropriate branch for your OXID eShop version into the shop's ``Application/views`` directory:

```
cd DOCUMENT_ROOT/Application/views/
git clone -b BRANCH_NAME https://github.com/OXID-eSales/flow_theme.git flow
```

You should now have a new folder ``DOCUMENT_ROOT/Application/views/flow``.

### Step 3: Prepare the database (< version 6.0 only)

In order to install the theme options, import the ``setup.sql`` into your database.

#### Option 1: Console

``mysql -u MYSQL_USER -p SHOP_DATABASE < flow/setup.sql``

#### Option 2: Shop Admin: Service -> Tools

If you have a local copy of flow files, go to Service -> Tools in Shop Admin, upload flow/setup.sql and click "start update" button

### Step 4: Prepare the ``out`` folder

The ``out`` folder can be prepared in two possible ways. The first option is to use symbolic links, the second is to copy. Using a symbolic link is strongly recommended, as otherwise you would have do the copying everytime *Flow* is updated.

#### Option 1: Symbolic Linking

Link the theme's ``out`` directory to the ``out`` directory of the shop:

``ln -s ../Application/views/flow/out/flow ../../out/flow``

#### Option 2: Copying

Copy theme's ``out`` directory to shop:

``cp -r flow/out/flow ../../out/flow``

You now should be able to do ``cd ../../out/flow``.

### Step 5: Activate theme 

Log into the admin panel, go to *Extensions → Themes → Flow* and press the *Activate* button. Clean the cache and off you go, my friend!

## Development

All *Flow* theme related CSS/Javascript files can be found in theme's ``build`` directory. To regenerate the theme's assets, the ``grunt`` tasks should be used. Please install ``grunt`` and run ``grunt's`` default task to regenerate all minimized ``css`` and ``js`` files:

1. To use ``grunt``, ``npm`` is required. Check ``nodejs`` website for installation
instructions (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). Example of
Installation on ubuntu system:

	```
	curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
	sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
	```

2. Install ``grunt`` globally and update npm. Example:

	```
    sudo npm install -g npm grunt-cli 
    ```

3. Go to "flow" theme's directory and install all related ``grunt`` plugins:

	```
    cd DOCUMENT_ROOT/Application/views/flow/
    npm install
    ```

4. Now its possible to regenerate "flow" theme assets by running ``grunt`` default
task while being in "flow" directory:

	```
	grunt
	```
